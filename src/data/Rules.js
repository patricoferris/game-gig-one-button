    "You are free to do whatever you like with your game after the Game Gig. You own the copyright to all the material you create during the event.",
    "You are free to use any tools or libraries available to you to create your game. You can start with any pre-existing code or content that you like and you are free to use third-party assets, as long as you let the judges know what you created yourself and what you didn't. Failure to do so could risk disqualification.",
    "It\'s your responsibility to make sure that you have the right to use third-party assets (for example, that they are public domain or available under an appropriate license).",
    "We will be taking lots of photos throughout the event, and publishing them. You and your content may appear on some of these photos. We aim to publish photos that show everyone at their best, but there might be a few that you donâ€™t like. If you see a photo like this, let us know so that we can try to take it down - but be aware that it is difficult to completely erase a photo from all media channels.",
